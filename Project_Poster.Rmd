# Issues & Problems

Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, aims to move the national capital from Jakarta to Kalimantan to address economic inequality and to relieve some of Jakarta’s serious urban problems. However, there have been doubts about whether this relocation plan will solve Jakarta’s problems and concerns surrounding the impact of relocation on Kalimantan. 

# Motivation
- Analyse the current social, economic, and environmental conditions of Kalimantan;

- And determine a suitable site, based on the aforementioned three factors, in Kalimantan to relocate the capital.

# Approach
## Task 1

1. Obtain East Kalimantan Province as study area

2. Select and showcase relevant layers for consideration for survey report

## Task 2
1. Rasterize vector layers to be considered for site suitability

2. Generate proximity maps from the rasterized layer of each component

3. Standardisation of data using Z-Score to ensure all maps are on the same scale

4. Use AHP Analysis to obtain the relative weightage of each component
5. Using the Raster Calculator, compile the different maps of the components into a single output with the multiplication of their Z-scores to their weightage from the AHP Analysis
6. Only areas with 0.5 as their minimum level to be considered “suitable”
7. Polygonize current layer into a vector layer, where the subzones within the suitable sites are picked out
8. Calculate areas of the potential subzone sites 
9. Eliminate subzones not within the required area size (4500-5500 hectares) using select by expression
10.  Compare areas which meet all criteria to be considered a suitable site with the components once more to recommend one final site

We set n = 9 for the number of criterias to be used in our AHP calculation and ranked these criteria at varying importance level based on the fundamental scale, which will be further explained later. The consistency check of 5% is below 10% and the inconsistency is acceptable. With the final calculated AHP scores, each criteria had a different and relevant importance level to the context of relocating Indonesia’s capital, which aid in the process of determining the final suitable site.</figcaption>

Since Prangat Selatan has 3 orange highlighted cells compared to Prangat Baru with 2 orange highlighted cells, Prangat Selatan is a more ideal suitable site for the new capital. </figcaption>

# Future Work

In the scope of urban planning, there are many factors to take into consideration. The focus of our project was determining the best suitable site to relocate the capital city of Indonesia to. Despite having implemented a multi-criterion evaluation approach, specifically AHP analysis, to ascertain the varying importance of the 9 factors chosen, to identify a more accurate suitable site, more factors could have been taken into consideration. Not only should more physical and environmental factors be accounted for, but there is a need to involve the various stakeholders: government, businesses and society.
