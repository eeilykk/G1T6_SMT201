      "contents": "\r\n1.0 Introduction\r\nIn 2019, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo announced that his plan to move the national capital from Jakarta to the province of East Kalimantan. This relocation is to address economic inequality and relieve some of Jakarta’s serious urban problems. However, there have been doubts about whether this relocation plan will solve Jakarta’s problems and concerns surrounding the impact of relocation on Kalimantan. Our team aims to create digistised web maps via QGIS and analyse the geospatial patterns through various methods of analysis, to determine and recommend a suitable site for the relocation of the capital city.\r\n2.0 Project Proposal\r\n2.1 Motivation\r\nIn 2019, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo announced that his plan to move the national capital from Jakarta, on the island of Java, to the province of East Kalimantan, on Borneo. The relocation is believed to address economic inequality and relieve some of the heavy burden, which has led to serious urban problems - such as intensive floods, air pollution and overcrowding, on Jakarta (The Guardian, 2019). Moreover, compared to Jakarta, Kalimantan is located strategically in the centre of Indonesia and close to urban areas.\r\nHowever, the relocation has raised some concerns with environmentalists fearing the relocation will have negative effects on Kalimantan - ecologically damaging the rainforests habitat for wildlife species, notably the remaining orangutan population (Eliraz, 2020).\r\nHence, it is important to determine a suitable area in East Kalimantan for the relocation of the capital. Bearing in mind that the new area would meet the criteria of functioning as a capital city and as the centre of governance, without risking environmental damage to the rainforests and endangering wildlife.\r\n2.2 Objective\r\nOur team aims to fulfill the following project objectives:\r\n1.Creation of digitised web maps via QGIS to clearly show the different aspects of the study area\r\n2.Analysis of geospatial patterns in the compilation of maps created\r\n3.Integration of GIS and multi-criteria evaluation methods to perform site suitability analysis\r\n4.Discussion of method of analysis when weighing the different aspects for site suitability\r\n5.Providing a recommendation of a suitable site for the relocation of the capital city\r\n6.Gain experience in using QGIS and project exposure\r\n2.3 Data\r\nName\r\nData Format\r\nDescription\r\nLink\r\nBATAS DESA DESEMBER 2019 DUKCAPIL KALIMANTAN TIMUR\r\nShape files\r\nComprehensive population data of the East Kalimantan Province\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1aeD6kPAy6Uzzx61Z51mfEI5FQzDCY_kJ/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nKOTA_BALIKPAPAN\r\nShape files\r\nComprehensive collection of topographic data layers of Kota Balikpapan\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1VgxlToSH1auqApEgh_jAW06DKlBy67Bh/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nKOTASAMARINDA\r\nShape files\r\nComprehensive collection of topographic data layers of Kota Samarinda\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12kiqmm_wsyjc2-pqNO2e8TM_c-fMeTAk/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nPENAJAMPASERUTARA\r\nShape files\r\nComprehensive collection of topographic data layers of Penajam Paser Utara\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkS3y_pF7avPfvNTft7RK5W3p4fJ2KEr/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nKUTAITARTANEGARA\r\nShape files\r\nComprehensive collection of topographic data layers of Kutai Kartanegara\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1EfoR3qJEX1qX5d4tUOGFLhEaSxa4Du1o/view?usp=drivesdk\r\n30.

      "contents": "\r\nOur Study Area\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Map of Study Area\r\n1.1 Population & Demographics\r\n1.1.1 Population Density\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Population Density Map\r\nPopulation density is the number of people living in an area per square kilometre and is calculated by dividing the number of people over the size of the area. Population density allows us to determine the extent of an area being overpopulated or unoccupied. The population density of East Kalimantan is unevenly distributed, where the darker the purple colour, the greater the population density. Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan experiences the highest population density, with certain zones having a high population density of 2156 - 28047 people per square kilometre. On the other hand, Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara, notably the North, East and South-West of Kutai Kartanegara and the North-West of Penajam Paser Utara, experiences low population density, with certain zones having a population density as low as 0 - 48 people per square kilometre.\r\n1.1.2 Age Demographics\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Map of Population Aged 25 Years and Below\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Map of Population Aged 26 to 65 Years\r\n\r\nFigure 5. Map of Population Aged 66 Years and Above\r\nWe split the population of our study area into three groups: young (<= 25 years old), adult who are the economically active group (26 - 65 years old) and elderly (>= 66 years old). The darker the blue colour, the greater the population size. In line with our population density analysis in section 1.1.1, all three age demographics show a similar distribution to that of Figure 2., whereby the majority of the population of the three age demographics are found in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan and there’s a smaller population of the three age demographics found in Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara. This is due to the fact that Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan are cities - urbanised areas with greater and better quality employment and educational opportunities, compared to Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara which are regencies.\r\nWhile the distribution of each age demographics is similar across Figures 3. - 5., there is a smaller population of elderly along the West coast of Kutai Kartanegara, with a value of 11 - 44 elderly, in proportion to the population size of the young and adults. This can also be explained by the fact that Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan are cities with likely higher quality and advanced health services for the elderly. Hence, being in close proximity to these health services would be convenient for elderly, explaining the higher proportion of elderly living in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan.\r\nComparing the values of the population size across the three age demographics, the study area likely experiences a high youth age dependency ratio, although those aged 0 - 14 years old are considered youths. The population of the young is almost similar to that of the adults, who are considered the economically active group.\r\n1.2 Economic & Business\r\n\r\nTable 1. Percentage Distribution of Gross regional Domestic Product at Current Market Prices (%), in 2017 for all the provinces in Kalimantan (Idris, 2019)\r\nBased on a recent study on the economy of Sabah and Kalimantan, referring to Table 1, the information clearly shows that mining and quarrying, followed by manufacturing are the most important contributors to the income of East Kalimantan.\r\n\r\nFigure 6a. Distribution Map of Economic and Business Activity Points\r\n\r\nFigure 6b. Distribution Map of Economic and Business Activity Areas\r\nReferring to Figure 6a., the economic and business points are unevenly distributed across the study area. Majority of the economic and business points are concentrated at Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. Comparing between Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, besides commercial sites for both, recreational businesses predominantly occupy Kota Samarinda, while industrial sites predominately occupy Kota Balikpapan. Manufacturing locations, which is one of East Kalimantan’s primary source of income, are rather sparse but can be found along the outskirts of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan.\r\nReferring to Figure 6b., the agricultural land is rather evenly distributed across the study area, with the exception of the South of Penajam Paser Utara having a large plot of agricultural land. Regarding the distribution of mining fields, which is East Kalimantan primary source of income, majority of the mining fields are concentrated in Kutai Kartangeara, specifically around the outskirts of Kota Samarinda. However, there is still considerably little mining fields in the study area.\r\nReferring to both Figure 6a. And 6b., there is barely any economic and business activity in the North and South-West of Kutai Kartanegara.\r\n1.3 Transport & Communication\r\n\r\nFigure 7. Distribution Map of Transport and Communication\r\nTransportation terminals and telecommunication points are unevenly distributed across the study map. All three transportation terminals, bus terminal, seaports and airports, are found concentrated in and around the outskirts of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. Notably, there are only two airports in the study area, of which one each is located along the edges of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. There are some seaports located away in Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara, but majority of the seaports are located in or near Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan.\r\nTelecommunication points are significantly concentrated in Kota Samarinda, with some located randomly in Kutai Kartanegara and Kota Balikpapan. Notably, there is little to no telecommunication point in Penajam Paser Utara.\r\n1.4 Infrastructure\r\n\r\nFigure 8. Distribution Map of Infrastructure\r\nInfrastructure is unevenly distributed across the study area, with most of the infrastructure concentrated in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. Education and public health are the two infrastructures that are the most distributed across the study area. Besides Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, education and public health infrastructure can be found in the South of Penajam Paser Utara, in the South, West and along the coast of the South-East of Kutai Kartanegara. However, infrastructure, like water, electricity and public amenities, is predominantly found in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, with an exception of along the coast of the South-East of Kutai Kartanegara. This distribution is likely due to the fact that Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan are cities, urbanised and with a higher population density.\r\n1.5 Environment and Hazard\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Distribution Map of Non-Agriculture Land\r\nThe predominant non-agriculture greenery is bush in the study area. Both Kota Samarinda and the South of Kutai Kartanegara has a high area of non-agriculture bush area. On the other hand, there is a low are of non-agriculture land and forest in the study area. The majority of non-agriculture land is found to the East of Kutai Kartanegara. There are two areas of non-agriculture forest found in the study area, with the smaller and bigger area found towards the East and South of Kutai Kartanegara respectively.\r\n\r\nFigure 10. Distribution Map of Water Bodies and Coastline\r\nThe most significant water body in the study area is the large area of pond at the East of Kutai Kartanegara, followed by the major river that cuts across the width of, from the West to the East of, Kutai Kartanegara and Kota Samarinda. There are multiple small water bodies of swamps and lakes scatter across the study area. The coastline stretches along the East coast of the study area, covering the East coast of both Kutai Kartanegara and Kota Balikpapan, up till the around the mid point of the East coast of Penajam Paser Utara.\r\n\r\nFigure 11. Distribution Map of Forest Fire Hot Spots\r\nForest fire hot spots are found predominantly towards the and are scattered around the North of the study area.\r\n1.6 Geology\r\n\r\nFigure 12. Geology Map\r\nThe distribution of geology sediments follows a trend, whereby the primary sediment is sandstone found along the entire West to central of the study area. The sediment trend then transitions to claystone and then alluvium when nearing the East coast of the study area, as the land is closer towards the ocean. An exception is flish sediment that is found amidst sandstone and claystone.\r\n#1.7 Topography\r\n\r\nFigure 13a. Topography Map\r\n\r\nFigure 13b. 3D Topography Map (Top View)\r\n\r\nFigure 13c. 3D Topography Map (Side View)\r\nThere is a series of steep slopes at the South-West region of the study area, reaching peaks of up to 867m which can indicate a mountain range as mountains are landforms that rise above 300m. Other than that, there are a few areas of slight elevation at the Northern, central and Southern regions of the study area. The areas at the East hardly have any elevation, as it is the delta of the major rivers.\r\n1.8 References\r\n​​Idris, R., Mansur, K., & Idris, R. Z. (2019). Economy of Kalimantan: a Snapshot.

      "contents": "\r\n1.0 Site Selection Report\r\nIn this section, we will be thoroughly investigating and analysing the study area, to select a suitable site within our study area for the proposed new capital city based on four overarching criteria:\r\nSizable\r\nHigh accessibility\r\nSafety\r\nEase of development\r\n2.0 AHP Analysis\r\nBefore performing site selection, we conducted Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) analysis to determine which criteria are more important in decision making by quantifying them. This aids in the process of achieving our goal: to determine a suitable area in East Kalimantan for the relocation of the capital. Bearing in mind that the new area would meet the criteria of functioning as a capital city and as the centre of governance, without risking environmental damage to the rainforests and endangering wildlife.\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Pairwise Comparison Matrix\r\n\r\nFigure 2. AHP Scores\r\nWe set n = 9 for the number of criterias to be used in our AHP calculation and ranked these criteria at varying importance level based on the fundamental scale, which will be further explained later. The consistency check of 5% is below 10% and the inconsistency is acceptable. With the final calculated AHP scores, each criteria had a different and relevant importance level to the context of relocating Indonesia’s capital, which aid in the process of determining the final suitable site.\r\nRanking\r\nCriterion\r\nReason\r\n1\r\nRivers\r\nEast Kalimantan is classified as a high risk exposure to a high level of river flood hazard, meaning that potentially damaging and life-threatening river floods are expected to occur at least once in the next 10 years (ThinkHazard, n.d.). With a building of a city, an urban area, there is a risk of urban floods due to the impemearble urban surface. Moreover, with climate change, there has been more frequent and extreme heavy rainfall events, increasing the river flood hazard level in the near future.\r\n1\r\nForests\r\nIf the chosen site for relocation is on or near forested areas, deforestation would likely take place to make space for buildings and urbanisation. However, East Kalimantan is known for its large areas of forests where indigneous people live and various wildlife habitat, such as orangutans (Chandran, 2019). With deforestation, indigneous people would be displaced along with a loss of cultural heritage and also endangering wildlife species. Moreover, with global warming, deforestation should be avoided as much as possible.\r\n1\r\nRoads\r\nRoad infrastructure is a very important public asset. Roads provide high accessibility and convenience, and open up more areas, of which all stimulate economic development and bring about social benefits (Malkoc, 2015). For example, one aspect to address economic inequality and poverty, which is one reason Jokowi called for the relocation of the capital, is through providing access to employment, social, health and education services.\r\n4\r\nHotspots\r\nIf the chosen site for relocation is near a fire hotspot, there can be considerable financial losses for the new capital. Outbreaks of wildfire can disrupt the living conditions of those in the capital. Moreover, the capital would need to channel resources to wildfire mitigation measures. As such, it is preferable for the new capital to be located away from hotspots. However, compared to floods, the frequency and severity of wildfires are primarily influenced by the changing climate and not much by urbanisation. Hence, hotspots are of a lower rank of importance compared to rivers.\r\n5\r\nSlope\r\nIt is important for the selected site to avoid steep slopes due to the high development costs and constraints when developing buildings on slopes. Moreover, buildings and housings are more susceptible to landslides hazards on slopes. However, there can be landslide mitigation measures for buildings. The risks and severity of landslides are also dependent on the soil type.\r\n6\r\nAirports\r\nAirports are important to the economic sector of the capital, maintaining and improving the capital’s national and international trade relations, and are catalysts for tourism growth (Berti, 2019). However, it is important to note that airports need to be strategically located. Not only do airports need to be close and accessible for the citizens, thus the importance of roads before airports, they also need to be of a certain distance from residential areas as much as possible due to noise pollution.\r\n7\r\nBuildings\r\nIt is important for the selected site to be near to current urban settlement areas, such that the new capital can leverage on and build relationships existing economic and business in the current urban settlement areas. However, it should not be at current major settlement areas to minimise overcrowding and noise pollution. Long travelling distances between urban areas can always be solved by high accessibility and efficiency roads.\r\n8\r\nCoastline\r\nWhile it is important for the selected site to avoid being near sea costs due to natural disasters such as coastal flooding and tsunamis, the frequency of tsunamis specifically happens once every five years mostly on the islands of Sumatra and Java (Indonesia Investments, 2019). Moreover, Indonesia has wave breakers in place to mitigate coastal floods. Lastly, while it is ideal to be located away from coastlines, seaports are often located near coastlines.\r\n9\r\nSeaports\r\nWhile seaports act as trade facilitators, with climate change and rising sea levels, there is a risk of seaports being inundated.\r\n1.3 Narrowing Down the Suitable Sites\r\n\r\nFigure 3. AHP-Suitability Layer\r\nWe used the factor scores derived in Figure 2. to compute the land suitability layer (Figure 3.). Locations with values closer to 1, which is represented as a whiter area on the map, are more suitable than locations with values closer to 0, which is represented as a blacker area on the map.\r\n\r\nFigure 4. MCDA Model of Suitability Layer\r\nFrom Figure 3., we created a binary land suitability model for easier visualisation for areas that are suitable or not suitable for the new capital. It is recommended that the selected site should have at least a composite critierion scores of 0.5. As such, locations with the value of 1 denotes suitable, which is represented by white, and with the value of 0 denotes not suitable, which is represented by black. Referring to Figure 4., it is visually easier to identify areas that are suitable, which are the white areas towards the North of the study area, and we can disregard the black areas.\r\n\r\nFigure 5. Vectorised Model of Suitability Layer\r\n\r\nFigure 6. Potential Suitable Sites based on Area\r\nReferring to Figure 6., the brown area is identified as the potential suitable area for the new capital, which aligns with the white areas shown in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Figure 7. Potential Suitable Final Sites based on Subzones](GIS Task 2/3 Potential Final Sites (Area not taken into account.png)\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 6., we chose subzones where the whole area is of complete suitability, i.e. no small area within a subzone is of black colour (Figure 4.). This narrowed down the results to 8 subzones as potential final sites for the new capital.\r\n\r\nFigure 8. Final Suitable Sites\r\nBearing in mind that the AHP score does not account for the size of the subzone, we further narrowed down from 8 to 2 subzones by eliminating subzones that are not of 4500-5500 hectares in size. The remaining 2 subzones, shaded in grey, are Prangat Baru (bottom) and Prangat Selatan (top).\r\n1.4 Comparing the Final Sites: Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan\r\nAs both Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan subzones meet all the criterias of a suitable site, we did an in-depth comparison between both subzones based on the 9 criteria to determine the final suitable site for the new capital.\r\n1.4.1 Comparing Distribution of Rivers\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Distribution of Rivers\r\nThe rivers are identified by the red polygons. There are no rivers located in close proximity to Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan. However, between Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan, Prangar Baru is located closer to the major river in East Kalimantan.\r\n1.4.2 Comparing Locations of Forests\r\n\r\nFigure 10. Location of Forests\r\nThe forest areas are identified by the green polygons. However, as the size of the polygons are rather smaller, the forest areas have been identified by the red circles. There are forests located in close proximity to Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan. Although Prangar Baru is located closer to a forest than Prangar Selatan, the distance between the forest and Prangar Baru is very great, such that there is no cause and effect relationship between the forest and Prangar Baru.\r\n1.4.3 Comparing Distribution of Roads\r\n\r\nFigure 11. Distribution of Roads\r\n1.4.4 Comparing Distribution of Hotspots\r\n\r\nFigure 12. Distribution of Hotspots\r\nThe West of Prangat Baru has two hotspot locations, while Prangat Selatan has no hotspots located within her subzone.\r\n1.4.5 Comparing Distribution of Slope\r\n\r\nFigure 13. Distribution of Slopes\r\nThe white areas represent steeper slopes, while the darker areas represent gentler slopes. Since Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan are neighbouring regions and referring to Figure 13., both subzones experience rather similar slopes.\r\n1.4.6 Comparing Location of Airports\r\n\r\nFigure 14. Location of Airports\r\nThe locations of the airports can be identified by the green dot, circled by a red circle. Prangat Baru is in closer proximity to an airport than Prangat Selatan.\r\n1.4.7 Comparing Distribution of Buildings\r\n\r\nFigure 15. Distribution of Buildings\r\nWhile there is a small urban settlement located within Prangat Selatan, Prangat Baru is in closer proximity to a major urban settlement than Prangat Selatan.\r\n##1.4.8 Comparing Distribution of Coastline\r\n\r\nFigure 16. Distribution of Coastline\r\nThe coastline can be identified by the red lines. Both Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan are about an equal distance from the coastline.\r\n1.4.9 Comparing Locations of Seaports\r\n\r\nFigure 17. Location of Seaports\r\nThe location of the seaports can be identified by the light yellow dots. Prangat Selatan is in closer proximity to a seaport than Prangat Baru.\r\n1.5 Overview of Comparison between Prangat Baru and Prangat Selatan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to Table 1., the orange highlighted cell indicates a preference of the respective criterion for the corresponding site. Since Prangat Selatan has 3 orange highlighted cells compared to Prangat Baru with 2 orange highlighted cells, Prangat Selatan is a more ideal suitable site for the new capital.\r\nMoreover, out of the 3 orange highlighted cells of Prangat Selatan, 2 of them (i.e. rivers and hotspots) has a higher AHP score than the 2 orange highlighted cells (i.e. airpots and buildings) of Prangat Baru. Notably, river flooding and wildfires are natural occurrence which cannot be prevented, but only mitigated. On the other hand, being in closer proximity to airports and buildings can always be achieved indirectly, when considering travelling time, with a more efficient road network.\r\n1.6 Conclusion\r\n\r\nFigure 18. Finale Selected Suitable Site\r\nPrangat Selatan is the final selected suitable site for the new capital.\r\n#1.7 References Berti, A. (2019, June 7).
