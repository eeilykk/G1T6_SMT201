      "contents": "\r\nMotivation\r\nIn 2019, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo announced that his plan to move the national capital from Jakarta, on the island of Java, to the province of East Kalimantan, on Borneo. The relocation is believed to address economic inequality and relieve some of the heavy burden, which has led to serious urban problems - such as intensive floods, air pollution and overcrowding, on Jakarta. Moreover, compared to Jakarta, Kalimantan is located strategically in the centre of Indonesia and close to urban areas.\r\nHowever, the relocation has raised some concerns with environmentalists fearing the relocation will have negative effects on Kalimantan: ecologically damaging the rainforests habitat for wildlife species, notably the remaining orangutan population.\r\nHence, it is important to strategise and identify a suitable area in Kalimantan to build the new capital, such that it would meet the criteria of functioning as a city and as the centre of governance without risking environmental damage to the rainforests and endangering wildlife.\r\nObjective\r\nData\r\nScope of Work\r\nProject Schedule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, there have been doubts about whether this relocation plan will solve Jakarta’s problems and concerns surrounding the impact of relocation on Kalimantan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nAnalyse the current social, economic, and environmental conditions of Kalimantan;\r\nAnd determine a suitable site, based on the aforementioned three factors, in Kalimantan to relocate the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n\r\nTask 1\r\nObtain East Kalimantan Province as study area\r\nSelect and showcase relevant layers for consideration for survey report\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 2\r\nRasterize vector layers to be considered for site suitability\r\nGenerate proximity maps from the rasterized layer of each component\r\nStandardisation of data using Z-Score to ensure all maps are on the same scale\r\nUse AHP Analysis to obtain the relative weightage of each component\r\nUsing the Raster Calculator, compile the different maps of the components into a single output with the multiplication of their Z-scores to their weightage from the AHP Analysis\r\nOnly areas with 0.5 as their minimum level to be considered “suitable”\r\nPolygonize current layer into a vector layer, where the subzones within the suitable sites are picked out\r\nCalculate areas of the potential subzone sites\r\nEliminate subzones not within the required area size (4500-5500 hectares) using select by expression\r\nCompare areas which meet all criteria to be considered a suitable site with the components once more to recommend one final site\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shows the map of the study area, East Kalimantan, broken down into four areas: Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam Paser Utara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation density allows us to determine the extent of an area being overpopulated or unoccupied. Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan experiences the highest population density, with certain zones having a high population density of 2156 - 28047 people per square kilometre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe split the population of our study area into three groups: young (<= 25 years old), adult who are the economically active group (26 - 65 years old) and elderly (>= 66 years old).The majority of the population of the three age demographics are found in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic and business points are unevenly distributed across the study area. Majority of the economic and business points are concentrated at Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. The agricultural land is rather evenly distributed across the study area, with the exception of the South of Penajam Paser Utara having a large plot of agricultural land. Regarding the distribution of mining fields, which is East Kalimantan primary source of income, majority of the mining fields are concentrated in Kutai Kartangeara, specifically around the outskirts of Kota Samarinda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three transportation terminals, bus terminal, seaports and airports, are found concentrated in and around the outskirts of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan.Telecommunication points are significantly concentrated in Kota Samarinda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfrastructure is unevenly distributed across the study area, with most of the infrastructure concentrated in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. Education and public health are the two infrastructures that are the most distributed across the study area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe predominant non-agriculture greenery is bush in the study area. There are two areas of non-agriculture forest found in the study area, with the smaller and bigger area found towards the East and South of Kutai Kartanegara respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most significant water body in the study area is the large area of pond at the East of Kutai Kartanegara, followed by the major river that cuts across the width of, from the West to the East of, Kutai Kartanegara and Kota Samarinda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForest fire hot spots are found predominantly towards the and are scattered around the North of the study area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distribution of geology sediments follows a trend, whereby the primary sediment is sandstone found along the entire West to central of the study area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a series of steep slopes at the South-West region of the study area, reaching peaks of up to 867m which can indicate a mountain range as mountains are landforms that rise above 300m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final site we have chosen is Prangat Selatan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore performing site selection, we conducted Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) analysis to determine which criteria are more important in decision making by quantifying them. We set n = 9 for the number of criterias to be used in our AHP calculation and ranked these criteria at varying importance level based on the fundamental scale, which will be further explained later. The consistency check of 5% is below 10% and the inconsistency is acceptable. With the final calculated AHP scores, each criteria had a different and relevant importance level to the context of relocating Indonesia’s capital, which aid in the process of determining the final suitable site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did an in-depth comparison between both subzones based on the 9 criteria to determine the final suitable site for the new capital.The orange highlighted cell indicates a preference of the respective criterion for the corresponding site. Since Prangat Selatan has 3 orange highlighted cells compared to Prangat Baru with 2 orange highlighted cells, Prangat Selatan is a more ideal suitable site for the new capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\nIn the scope of urban planning, there are many factors to take into consideration. The focus of our project was determining the best suitable site to relocate the capital city of Indonesia to. Despite having implemented a multi-criterion evaluation approach, specifically AHP analysis, to ascertain the varying importance of the 9 factors chosen, to identify a more accurate suitable site, more factors could have been taken into consideration. Not only should more physical and environmental factors be accounted for, but there is a need to involve the various stakeholders: government, businesses and society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
